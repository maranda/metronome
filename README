<=========================================================================================

This software codebase initiated as a fork of prosody trunk (to be 0.9) merged with 
LW.Org's custom, patches initiating from August 7th 2012 (see first commit).

Being mainly based on Prosody a lot of Metronome's code is backport compatible, but as
development progressed a good portion of it completely diverged from mainstream's to
better suit LW.Org IM's needs.

The main differences from Prosody are:

 * The Pubsub API and wrapped modules, mod_pubsub and mod_pep;
 * The MUC API and wrapper plugins;
 * Pluggable MUC configuration;
 * Pluggable Routing API;
 * Core stack: Modulemanager, Usermanager, Hostmanager, Module API, etc... ;
 * More aggressive memory usage optimisations
 * Bidirectional S2S Streams
 * Advanced Dialback errors handling
 * More tight integration with Stream Management
 * The anonymous auth backend (mod_auth_anonymous & sasl.lua ineherent part);
 * Included plugins, utils;
 * The HTTP API;
 * BOSH's JSON Padding and XEP-252 support.
 * Extensive Microblogging over XMPP support.
 * Daemon Control Utility;
 * It does have _only_ one server backend being libevent and has a hard dep. on lua-event.
